## HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational component of web application front ends, providing the core structure for all web pages through a hierarchical tree format where elements like <html>, <head>, and <body> contain nested components such as titles, headings, paragraphs, forms, and images.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a core web technology used alongside HTML to control the visual appearance and layout of web pages, including fonts, colors, spacing, alignment, positioning, and backgrounds.

## Javascript
JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language primarily for web and mobile development, enabling dynamic and interactive functionality on web pages beyond the static structure and styling provided by HTML and CSS.

## HTML Injection
HTML Injection occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on web pages without proper validation and sanitization, allowing users to submit malicious HTML code that browsers render as part of the page.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploits HTML injection vulnerabilities by injecting JavaScript code for client-side execution, potentially compromising victim accounts.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) exploits authenticated sessions to perform unauthorized actions as victims, often utilizing XSS vulnerabilities or HTTP parameters.

## Back End Servers
Back-end servers are the hardware and operating systems hosting web applications, containing three core components: web servers (Apache, NGINX, IIS), databases (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle), and development frameworks (PHP, C#, Java).

## Web Servers
Web servers are applications running on back-end servers that handle HTTP traffic on ports 80/443, routing requests and returning responses with status codes (200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND, 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.).

## Databases
Databases store web application content, assets, and user data. Relational (SQL) databases like MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL organize data in tables with rows, columns, and keys linked through schemas, ideal for structured datasets.

## Development Frameworks & APIs
Web development frameworks simplify building complex web applications by providing reusable functionality like user registration and linking front-end and back-end components.

Understanding web applications requires a holistic view of both front-end and back-end components, their architectures, and associated vulnerabilities. Front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript deliver user interfaces but can expose sensitive data, while back-end servers, web servers, databases, and frameworks power functionality yet remain targets for critical attacks
