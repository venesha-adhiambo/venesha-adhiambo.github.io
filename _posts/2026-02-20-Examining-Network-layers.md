OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done.
The first three OSI model layers are; Physical, Data Link and Nework.
- Layer3: The network layer provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.
- Layer 2: The data link layer protocols describe methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media.
- Layer 1: The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and deactivate physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device.

As data moves through the network, it is broken down into smaller pieces and identified so that the pieces can be put back together when they arrive at the destination.
Each piece is assigned a specific name (protocol data unit [PDU]) and associated with a specific layer of the TCP/IP and OSI models.
Packet Tracer simulation mode enables one to view each of the layers and the associated PDU.
